## Overview
`SEGAN` is a project aims to control semantic attributes of results generated by [StyleGAN2](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Karras_Analyzing_and_Improving_the_Image_Quality_of_StyleGAN_CVPR_2020_paper.html) through modified it's latent space. In their paper, they discussed the impact of latent space on the results of human face images, lower layers affect more general semantic attributes, such as gender, skin color, and higher layers affect in details, such as smiles, hairstyles, etc. It is worth noting that the latent space here is not equal to the space of the initial noise sampled in the original [GAN](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2014/hash/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Abstract.html), we will discuss it more in next section. They used this discovery to do "StyleMix", it can mix styles from different seed images to cantrol the semantic attributes of new generated images. But this control is not precise, it is difficult to decouple semantic attributes and control them independently in this way. Therefore, SEGAN introduces a linear subspace to locate the part of the latent space vector that has a higher impact on the semantic result, which improves StyleGAN2 in semantic control.

[StyleGAN](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Karras_A_Style-Based_Generator_Architecture_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.html) has a intermediate latent space $W
